## Challonge Match Display

Windows application that displays pending matches of a challonge bracket. Useful when hosting a tournament to keep the players better informed with what matches are active and who is still in the tournament.

### Web-Based Alternative

One of our contributors, @gazugafan, has developed [RoundOne](https://round.one): a drop-in replacement for challonge that includes many of the features found here. It's not open-source, but it is free to use.
